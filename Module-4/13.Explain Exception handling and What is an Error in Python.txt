--> There are two types of error in python :-
    1) Syntax Error
    2) Exception Error

--> If There is an error in program at run time error will shown and program stop.
    and Next condition true but not shown that's why we use exception handling.

--> We see above that if our first condition is False so program stop and also our 
    second condition is true either it will not run due to stop the program from
    error detect.

--> Using exception handling we can prevents to stop the program at execution time
    so we can save our program.

--> Exception is an error that happens during the execution of a program.
    Whenever there is an error, Python generates an exception that could be handled.
    It basically prevents the program from getting crashed.
