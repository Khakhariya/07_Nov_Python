--> oops is object oriented programming.
--> python is also object oriented programming
    language.

1) Class :- A class is a collection of objects.
            A class contains the blueprints of objects or 
            The prototype from which the objects are being created. 

2) Object :- Object is instance of class

3) Inheritance :-Reusability of Class
    
--> Types of Inheritance :-
                            1_ Single Inheritance
                            2_ Multiple Inheritance
                            3_ Multilevel Inheritance
                            4_ Multiple Inheritance.
                            5_ Hybrid Inheritance.

4) Polymorphism :- It is called that one name and many form  or 
                   different work but name same.

--> Types of Polymorphism :-
                            1_ Overloading
                            2_ Overriding

5) Encapsulation :- wrapping up the data in one class or bind up
                    the data in class it is called Encapsulation.

                    Encapsulation is a example of capsul in which
                    powder of many medicines.

6) Access specifier or modifier :-
                                1_Public
                                2_Private

B) Is multiple inheritance supported in java ?

--> Yes ,multiple inheritance is supported in java.

--> It is the ability of a class to implement more than one interface.
--> An object can have multiple types:
    The type of its own class and the types of all the interfaces that the class implements.

    Types of Inheritance in java :-
    
    1) Single-level inheritance.
    2) Multi-level Inheritance.
    3) Hierarchical Inheritance.
    4) Multiple Inheritance.
    5) Hybrid Inheritance.
