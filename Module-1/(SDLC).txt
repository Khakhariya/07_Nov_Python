     3.Presentation programs
     4.Simulation software

   3.What is programing?
---> Computer programming is the process of performing a particular 
     computation,usually by designing and building an executable computer
     program.Programming involves tasks such as analysis,generating 
     algorithms,profiling algorithms accuracy and resource consumption,
     and the implementation of algorithms.
   
   4.What is Python?
---> Python is a high-level,general-purpose programming language.Its design
     philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant
