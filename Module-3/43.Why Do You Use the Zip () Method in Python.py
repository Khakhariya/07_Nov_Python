--> we use zip() method to merge to list in
    python.

--> Python zip() method takes iterable or containers
    and returns a single iterator object, having 
    mapped values from all the containers.

--> It is used to map the similar index of multiple 
    containers so that they can be used just using 
    a single entity.
