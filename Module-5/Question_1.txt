[Q-1] Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you can create a project in Django?

--> Django is the best framework for web applications, as it allows developers to use modules for faster development. As a developer, you can make use 
    of these modules to create apps, websites from an existing source. It speeds up the development process greatly, as you do not have to code 
    everything from scratch.

--> 1) first install django in cmd :-  pip install django
    2) Then create project :- django-admin startproject project-name.
    3) Then run the server :- python manage. py runserver.
